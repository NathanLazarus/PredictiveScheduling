This is joint work with Whitney Zhang, looking into the consequences of predictive scheduling laws.

In OregonDiDPlots, we create difference-in-difference plots for wages, hours, and the variability of hours around the passage of the predictive scheduling law. This was made possible thanks to the Wage File Analysis Division of the Oregon Employment Department, which generously shared data.
